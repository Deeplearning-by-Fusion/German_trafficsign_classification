# German Traffic Signs classification in Google colab

This project aims at classifying traffic signs using deep learning method. I used **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark** 
whcih consists of more than 50,000 images of 43 classes.

## Pipeline :
  1. Google colaboratory authentication setup
  2. Load the data
  3. Data summary
  4. Data preprocessing
  5. Convolutional Neural Network Model
  6. Training and Evaluation
  
 
### Why Google Colab ? 
Colaboratory is a Google research project created to help machine learning education and research. Follow the upcomming steps to acess Google drive files in colab.

Google colab provides free GPU that could be very useful for training our model.

### Convolution Neural Network
In this project I am using Convolution Neural Networks which are giving promising results in computer vision problems. Inspired from VGG Netework, generally consists of 16-19 layers but i modified then for simplicity and to learn how convolutions work for image classification task.

### Results 

Validation accuracy : 99.4%

Test accuracy : 97.6%
